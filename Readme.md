## the future of food

Outsourcing and specialization are a human trend. The most famous example for this is the way we feed ourselves. We went from everyone hunting & gathering to almost everyone farming to almost noone farming. A continuation of this trend is to be expected.

Currently most food consumed in the western world (measured by # meals) is bought as ingredients in a supermarket and using those to prepare a meal. So when we apply the trend of specialization to the current state of affairs, we arrive at food delivery from restaurants. You outsources food preparation to the restaurant and likely outsourced the logistics to whatever delivery app you like the most.

But this comes at the limitation of scale and affordability since each meal is individually prepared and delivered. A service that deliveres you prepared food with a ~week shelf life and requires only to be heated up by the customer should be much more affordable and scaleable.
